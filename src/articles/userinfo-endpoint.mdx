## What is a userinfo endpoint?

In <Ref slug="openid-connect" />, a userinfo endpoint is an endpoint of the <Ref slug="openid-connect" headingId="openid-provider-op" /> that offers user information to <Ref slug="client">clients</Ref>. The userinfo endpoint is usually a supplementary endpoint to the <Ref slug="id-token" /> and allows clients to retrieve additional user information that is not included in the ID token.

The userinfo endpoint is defined in the [OpenID Connect Core specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) and is typically accessed by clients after they have obtained an ID token.

## How does a userinfo endpoint work?

When a client makes a request to the userinfo endpoint, it needs to include the access token obtained from the <Ref slug="token-request" /> and use `GET` or `POST` HTTP methods. The userinfo endpoint validates the access token and returns the user information in the response.

Here's a non-normative example of a userinfo request:

```http
GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
Host: openid-provider.example.com
Authorization: Bearer some-access-token
```

The exact path of the userinfo endpoint may vary in different OpenID Providers. You can refer to the provider's <Ref slug="openid-connect-discovery" /> to find the userinfo endpoint URL. If the access token is valid, the userinfo endpoint responds with the user information:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sub": "user123",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@foo.com",
  "birthdate": "1990-01-01",
  "address": {
    "street": "1234 Elm St",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

The response may contain various user attributes such as `name`, `email`, `birthdate`, and `address`; and typically, it contains more <Ref slug="claim">claims</Ref> than the <Ref slug="id-token" />. The actual attributes returned depend on the <Ref slug="openid-connect" headingId="openid-provider-op" /> configuration and the user's consent. Please refer to your OpenID Provider's documentation for the specific attributes available.

### Signing and encryption

The userinfo response can be signed and/or encrypted to ensure its integrity and confidentiality. If one or both of these protections are applied, the userinfo endpoint response will be a <Ref slug="jwt" /> instead of a plain JSON object.
