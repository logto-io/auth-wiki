## What is JSON Web Encryption (JWE)?

As defined in the RFC 7516, JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt data in JSON format. It adds a layer of confidentiality to the data, and is practicularly useful when transmitting sensitive information over an untrusted network.

JWE is often used in conjunction with <Ref slug="jwt">JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</Ref> to protect the payload data. For example, an <Ref slug="id-token" /> or <Ref slug="access-token" /> can be encrypted using JWE to ensure that the data is secure during transmission.

## How does JWE work?

JWE has two serialization formats: compact and JSON. Each format has its own way of representing the encrypted data.

### Compact serialization

In the compact serialization, the JWE is represented as a string with five Base64URL-encoded parts separated by dots (`.`). The five parts are:

```
{{header}}.{{encrypted-key}}.{{iv}}.{{ciphertext}}.{{tag}}
```

Each part has a specific purpose:

- `header`: Contains metadata about the encryption algorithm and key management.
- `encrypted-key`: The encrypted content encryption key (CEK) used to encrypt the payload.
- `iv`: The initialization vector used in the encryption process.
- `ciphertext`: The encrypted payload data.
- `tag`: The authentication tag used to verify the integrity of the encrypted data.

### JSON serialization

JSON serialization is more verbose and provides a structured way to represent the JWE. The JWE is represented as a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "protected": "{{protected-header}}",
  "unprotected": "{{unprotected-header}}",
  "header": "{{header}}",
  "encrypted_key": "{{encrypted-key}}",
  "iv": "{{iv}}",
  "ciphertext": "{{ciphertext}}",
  "tag": "{{tag}}",
  "aad": "{{additional-authenticated-data}}"
}
```

- `protected`: Contains the Base64URL-encoded protected header.
- `unprotected`: Contains JWE shared unprotected header.
- `header`: Contains the JWE per-recipient unprotected header.
- `encrypted_key`: Contains the encrypted content encryption key (CEK) that is Base64URL-encoded.
- `iv`: Contains the Base64URL-encoded initialization vector.
- `ciphertext`: Contains the Base64URL-encoded ciphertext (encrypted payload).
- `tag`: Contains the Base64URL-encoded authentication tag.
- `aad`: Contains the Base64URL-encoded additional authenticated data.

The client should be able to decrypt the JWE using the appropriate key and algorithm. A pre-communiated key or a key derived from a key agreement protocol can be used to decrypt the JWE.

For example, an <Ref slug="id-token" /> may be encrypted using JWE, and the client can decrypt it using the appropriate key obtained from the `jwks_uri` endpoint of the OpenID provider.
