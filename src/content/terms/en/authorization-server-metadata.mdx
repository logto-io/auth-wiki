## What is OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata?

OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata is a standardized format defined in [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) that enables OAuth 2.0 clients to automatically discover and obtain information needed to interact with OAuth 2.0 authorization servers.

This includes essential information such as endpoint locations, supported features, and server capabilities.

The metadata format provides a machine-readable configuration document that helps streamline the integration process between clients and authorization servers, reducing the need for manual configuration.

## How does OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata work?

In the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem, there are several key roles:
- <Ref slug="authorization-server"/>: Issues access tokens to clients after successfully authenticating the resource owner
- <Ref slug="client"/>: Application requesting access to protected resources
- <Ref slug="resource-owner"/>: Entity capable of granting access to protected resources
- <Ref slug="resource-server"/>: Server hosting protected resources

The Authorization Server Metadata provides a standardized way for clients to discover and understand how to interact with the authorization server. Here's how it works:

1. The client knows or discovers the authorization server's issuer URL
2. The client constructs the metadata URL by appending `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to the issuer URL
3. The client retrieves the metadata document containing server configuration
4. The client uses the retrieved metadata (endpoints, supported features, etc.) to properly configure itself and interact with the authorization server

For example, if the issuer URL is `https://auth.example.com`, the metadata would be available at:

`https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

The metadata document includes important information such as:
- `issuer`: The authorization server's identifier
- `authorization_endpoint`: The authorization endpoint URL
- `token_endpoint`: The token endpoint URL
- `scopes_supported`: Available scopes
- `response_types_supported`: Supported response types
- `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`: Supported client authentication methods

For a complete list of metadata fields, please refer to [RFC 8414 Section 2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-2).

With these metadata values, clients can automatically configure and execute the OAuth 2.0 flow:

1. **Initial setup**:
   - Client validates the `issuer` matches the expected authorization server
   - Client checks `response_types_supported` to ensure its flow type (e.g., `code`) is supported

2. **Authorization request**:
   - Client uses `authorization_endpoint` to construct the authorization URL
   - Client selects appropriate scopes from `scopes_supported` based on its needs
   - Example: `https://auth.example.com/authorize?response_type=code&scope=profile email`

3. **Token exchange**:
   - After receiving the authorization code, client uses `token_endpoint` for token exchange
   - Client checks `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` to determine how to authenticate (e.g., `client_secret_basic`)
   - Example: Send POST request to token endpoint with client credentials and authorization code

This basic flow helps clients automatically configure themselves and interact with the authorization server without manual endpoint configuration or trial-and-error scope selection.

## What is the difference between OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata and OpenID Connect Discovery?

The main differences are:

1. **Scope and Purpose**:
   - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata focuses specifically on OAuth 2.0 protocol configuration
   - <Ref slug="openid-connect-discovery"/> includes additional parameters for identity-related features, such as:
     - `userinfo_endpoint`: Endpoint for retrieving user information
     - `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported`: Supported signing algorithms for ID Tokens
     - `claims_supported`: Available user claims that can be returned in ID Token or from UserInfo Endpoint
     - Supports `openid` scope for authentication
     - Includes hybrid flow response types (e.g., `code id_token`, `code id_token token`)


2. **Metadata Endpoint**:
   - OAuth 2.0 uses `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
   - OpenID Connect uses `/.well-known/openid-configuration`

## Does OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata comply with OpenID Connect Discovery?

Yes, OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata is compatible with <Ref slug="openid-connect-discovery"/>.

The OAuth 2.0 metadata specification (RFC 8414) was inspired by OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0, which was already widely adopted in practice.

Key points about compliance:
1. The metadata format follows the same JSON structure
2. Authorization servers can support both endpoints simultaneously
3. OpenID Providers typically expose both endpoints for backward compatibility
4. The OAuth 2.0 metadata can be extended with OpenID Connect-specific fields when needed

This compatibility ensures that authorization servers can serve both pure OAuth 2.0 clients and OpenID Connect relying parties without conflicts.
