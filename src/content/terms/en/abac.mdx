title: Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
tags: [authorization]
description: Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control model that uses attributes (such as user roles, resource properties, and environmental conditions) to make access control decisions. It is a flexible and dynamic way to manage access to protected resources.

## What is attribute-based access control (ABAC)?

ABAC is an <Ref slug="access-control" /> model that uses attributes to make access control decisions. These attributes can include various factors, such as:

- User attributes: e.g., roles, department, location, etc.
- Resource attributes: e.g., sensitivity level, owner, type, etc.
- Environmental attributes: e.g., time of access, location, device, etc.

By evaluating these attributes and running them through a set of rules, ABAC can determine whether a subject (e.g., user, service) should be granted access to a resource. This approach allows for fine-grained access control and dynamic policy enforcement based on the context.

## How does ABAC work?

ABAC uses a policy-based approach to access control. A typical ABAC policy consists of:

- **Subject**: The entity requesting access (e.g., user, service, device).
- **Action**: The operation being performed on the resource (e.g., read, write, delete).
- **Resource**: The entity being accessed (e.g., file, database, API).
- **Environment**: The context in which the access is requested (e.g., time, location, device).
- **Attributes**: The properties of the subject, resource, and environment that are evaluated to make access decisions.
- **Policies**: A set of rules that define the conditions under which access is granted or denied.

ABAC policies are more complex than traditional access control models like <Ref slug="rbac" />. On the other hand, ABAC provides more flexibility and granularity in access control decisions.

### Example of ABAC policies

For example, a system has several ABAC policies:

1. **Policy 1**: Allow access if:

    - (Subject) Subject role is `manager`.
    - (Attribute) Resource sensitivity level is `high`.
    - (Environment) Location is `internal`.
    - (Action) Any action.
    - (Environment) Time is between 9 AM and 5 PM (office hours).

2. **Policy 2**: Deny access if:

    - (Subject) Subject role is not `manager`.
    - (Attribute) Resource sensitivity level is `high`.
    - (Environment) Any location.
    - (Action) Any action.
    - (Environment) Any time.

3. **Policy 3**: Allow access if:

    - (Subject) Subject role is `employee` or `manager`.
    - (Attribute) Resource sensitivity level is `low`.
    - (Environment) Any location.
    - (Action) `read` action.
    - (Environment) Any time.

The policy evaluation engine will check these policies in order, and the first policy that matches the conditions will determine the access decision. Meanwhile, a default deny policy is enforced if no other policies match.

Let's go through some scenarios to understand how ABAC works:

> **Scenario 1**. A user wants to access (perform `read` action) a high sensitivity level document (resource) outside of the office (environment). The user has the role of `manager` stored in the system.
  
**Decision**: Access is denied because the user is outside the office (location is not `internal`).

> **Scenario 2**. A user wants to access (perform `read` action) a high sensitivity level document (resource) during office hours (environment) in the office network (location=`internal`). The user has the role of `manager`.

**Decision**: Access is granted because all conditions in Policy 1 are met.

> **Scenario 3**. All conditions in scenarios 2 are the same, but the user has the role of `employee` instead of `manager`.

**Decision**: Access is denied because the user's role does not match the conditions in Policy 1.

> **Scenario 4**. A user wants to access (perform `read` action) a low sensitivity level document (resource). The user has the role of `employee`.

**Decision**: Access is granted because all conditions in Policy 3 are met.

> **Scenario 5**. A user wants to delete (perform `delete` action) a low sensitivity level document (resource). The user has the role of `employee`.

**Decision**: Access is denied because there is no policy that allows the `delete` action on low sensitivity level documents.

You may notice that not all attributes are required in every policy. This flexibility allows for a more dynamic and context-aware access control mechanism.

## eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)

XACML is an XML-based standard for expressing access control policies. While it doesn't define a specific access control model, XACML is often used to implement ABAC policies. Let's see a non-normative example of how XACML can be used to represent the ABAC policies from the previous example:

```xml
<PolicySet PolicySetId="ABAC_Policies" PolicyCombiningAlgId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:deny-overrides">
  <Policy PolicyId="Policy1" RuleCombiningAlgId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-overrides">
    <Target>
      <Subjects>
        <Subject>
          <SubjectMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
            <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">manager</AttributeValue>
            <SubjectAttributeDesignator AttributeId="role" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
          </SubjectMatch>
        </Subject>
      </Subjects>
      <Resources>
        <Resource>
          <ResourceMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
            <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">high</AttributeValue>
            <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId="sensitivity-level" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
          </ResourceMatch>
        </Resource>
      </Resources>
      <Environments>
        <Environment>
          <EnvironmentMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
            <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">internal</AttributeValue>
            <EnvironmentAttributeDesignator AttributeId="location" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
          </EnvironmentMatch>
        </Environment>
        <Environment>
          <EnvironmentMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:time-in-range">
            <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#time">09:00:00</AttributeValue>
            <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#time">17:00:00</AttributeValue>
            <EnvironmentAttributeDesignator AttributeId="time" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#time"/>
          </EnvironmentMatch>
        </Environment>
      </Environments>
    </Target>
    <Rule RuleId="Rule1" Effect="Permit"/>
  </Policy>
  <!-- Other policies (Policy 2, Policy 3) -->
</PolicySet>
```

## Implementation considerations

While ABAC provides a powerful way to manage access control, it also comes with some implementation considerations:

- System complexity: ABAC policies can become complex as the number of attributes and rules increases. Proper policy management and testing are more time-consuming than simpler access control models.
- Performance: Evaluating complex ABAC policies can impact system performance. Caching and optimization techniques can help mitigate this issue.
- Policy conflicts: Conflicting policies can lead to unpredictable access decisions. Regular policy review and conflict resolution should be part of the policy management process.

## ABAC vs. RBAC

Comparing ABAC with <Ref slug="rbac" /> can help you understand the differences between the two models:
