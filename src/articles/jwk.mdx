## What is a JSON Web Key (JWK)?

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON-based format used for representing cryptographic keys. It's widely used in the context of <Ref slug="jws" /> and <Ref slug="jwe" /> to validate the integrity and confidentiality of <Ref slug="jwt">JSON Web Tokens</Ref>. It is also used in <Ref slug="openid-connect" /> for identity and access management.

For example, a PEM-encoded ECDSA public key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MHYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEACIDYgAEF/xQdbOho2Jw0hgmNPD0VAEPAgkQrfD4
f1Qx3y49cUm646fMBX9DYx+43HzXm6VdX77uFymz90aO4dBunpTdUzLFRAiT7+In
gzZGDrIE+FG6CcqQuRP65r65SUzDOmP5
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

...can be represented as a JWK:

```json
{
  "kty": "EC",
  "crv": "P-384",
  "x": "F_xQdbOho2Jw0hgmNPD0VAEPAgkQrfD4f1Qx3y49cUm646fMBX9DYx-43HzXm6Vd",
  "y": "X77uFymz90aO4dBunpTdUzLFRAiT7-IngzZGDrIE-FG6CcqQuRP65r65SUzDOmP5"
}
```

## How does a JWK work?

Since JWK is a JSON-based format, it can carry rich metadata about the key compared to traditional formats like PEM. Here are some common attributes in a JWK:

- `kty` (Key Type): The cryptographic algorithm family used with the key. Common values include `RSA`, `EC`, and `oct`. `EC` has been marked as "Recommended+" in [RFC 7518](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518).
- `use` (Public Key Use): The intended use of the public key. Common values include `sig` (signature) and `enc` (encryption).
- `key_ops` (Key Operations): The key operations supported by the key. Common values include `sign`, `verify`, `encrypt`, and `decrypt`.
- `alg` (Algorithm): The algorithm intended for use with the key. Depending on the key type, the algorithm may vary. For example, `RS256` may be used with an RSA key, while `ES256` may be used with an EC key.
- `kid` (Key ID): A unique identifier for the key. It can be used to match a specific key in a set of keys.

Except `kty`, all other attributes are optional and can be used to provide additional context about the key. According to the value of `kty`, other attributes may be required or optional. In the above example, the JWK represents an ECDSA key (`kty: "EC"`) with a curve of P-384 (`crv: "P-384"`). The `x` and `y` attributes contain the public key coordinates.

Here's another non-normative example of an RSA public key JWK:

```json
{
  "kty": "RSA",
  "use": "sig",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "n": "0vx7agoebGcQSuuPiLJXZpt...-TmV4HCA1T8jXg3fE2VbA",
  "e": "AQAB",
  "kid": "2011-04-29-1234"
}
```

For detailed information about JWK attributes and their meanings, refer to [RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517).

## JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

When multiple JWKs need to be grouped together, they are organized into a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). A JWKS is a JSON object that contains an array of JWKs. It's commonly used in the response of the `jwks_uri` endpoint in <Ref slug="openid-connect-discovery" /> to provide the public keys for JWT <Ref slug="signing-key" /> validation.

Here's a non-normative example of a JWKS containing two JWKs:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "0vx7agoebGcQSuuPiLJXZpt...-TmV4HCA1T8jXg3fE2VbA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "kid": "2011-04-29-1234"
    },
    {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-384",
      "x": "F_xQdbOho2Jw0hgmNPD0VAEPAgkQrfD4f1Qx3y49cUm646fMBX9DYx-43HzXm6Vd",
      "y": "X77uFymz90aO4dBunpTdUzLFRAiT7-IngzZGDrIE-FG6CcqQuRP65r65SUzDOmP5"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the JWKS contains two JWKs: one RSA key and one EC key. The `keys` attribute is an array of JWKs, each representing a different key.
