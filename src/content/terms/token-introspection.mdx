## What is token introspection?

Token introspection is an OAuth 2.0 extension defined in [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662) that allows <Ref slug="client">clients</Ref> to query the <Ref slug="authorization-server" /> to validate access tokens and retrieve metadata about them. This extension is useful when:

- The client wants to verify the validity of an access token in real-time.
- The access token is <Ref slug="opaque-token">opaque</Ref> (not self-contained) and requires the authorization server to validate it.

## How does token introspection work?

Here's a non-normative example of a token introspection request:

```http
POST /introspect HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

token=random-token-value
  &token_type_hint=access_token
```

The `token_type_hint` parameter is optional and should be set to the type of token being introspected. If the access token is valid, the authorization server responds with the token's metadata:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "active": true,
  "scope": "read write",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "exp": 1634020800,
  "iat": 1634017200
}
```

It's worth noting that not all authorization servers support token introspection and not all tokens are introspectable. The <Ref slug="authorization-server" /> may limit the use of token introspection based various factors, for example, some authorization servers may not support introspection for <Ref slug="jwt">JWTs</Ref>.

### Key parameters in a token introspection request

Here are two key parameters in a token introspection request:

- **`token`**: The token to introspect.
- **`token_type_hint`**: The type of token being introspected. It can be `access_token` or `refresh_token`.
