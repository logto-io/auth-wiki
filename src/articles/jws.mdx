## What is JSON Web Signature (JWS)?

JSON Web Signature (JWS) defines a standard method for signing and verifying data in JSON format. It is widely used in modern applications and open standards such as <Ref slug="openid-connect" /> to ensure the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data.

JWS is particularly useful when working with <Ref slug="jwt">JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</Ref>. For instance, an <Ref slug="id-token" /> or <Ref slug="access-token" /> can be signed using JWS and verified by the recipient without making another network request.

## How does JWS work?

JWS uses cryptographic algorithms to sign the data and produce a signature. There are two main concepts in JWS: the JWS header and JWS serialization.

### JWS header

JWS has a header that contains important metadata about the signing algorithm and key management. Some common attributes in a JWS header include:

- `alg` (Algorithm): The cryptographic algorithm used for signing the data.
- `typ` (Type): The type of token, such as JWT.
- `kid` (Key ID): A unique identifier for the key used to sign the data.
- `jku` (JWK Set URL): The URL where the <Ref slug="jwk" headingId="json-web-key-set-jwks" /> is located.

For a detailed list of JWS header attributes, refer to [JOSE Header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4).

### JWS serialization

JWS has two serialization formats: compact and JSON. Each format has its own way of representing the signed data.

#### Compact serialization

In the compact serialization, the JWS is represented as a string with three Base64URL-encoded parts separated by dots (`.`). The three parts are:

```
{{header}}.{{payload}}.{{signature}}
```

Each part has a specific purpose:

- `header`: Metadata about the signing algorithm and key management in Base64URL-encoded format.
- `payload`: The data being signed in Base64URL-encoded format.
- `signature`: The cryptographic signature of the header and payload.

> [!Note]
> No unprotected header is included in the compact serialization.

For example, a JWS may look like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkFsaWNlIn0.Xv9da66g3y4nxs_0hlR9CBkOG9GkxfPmq1_7u4tNeXE
```

After decoding the Base64URL-encoded parts, the JWS consists of the following:

- Header: `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`
- Payload: `{"sub":"1234567890","name":"Alice"}`
- Signature: `Xv9da66g3y4nxs_0hlR9CBkOG9GkxfPmq1_7u4tNeXE`

The header specifies that the JWS is signed using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm (`HS256`) and the type of token is JWT (`typ: "JWT"`) in JSON format. The payload contains basic user information, such as the subject (`sub`) and name (`name`).

The signature is calculated by:

```
Hash(
  Base64URLEncode(header) || '.' || Base64URLEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

According to the JWS header, the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm is used in the `Hash` function, where the `secret` is the a shared secret key `top-secret` in this case.

For a detailed example of how JWS works with JWT, refer to the <Ref slug="signing-key" /> article.

#### JSON serialization

JSON serialization provides a more structured way to represent the JWS. The JWS is represented as a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "payload": "{{payload}}",
  "signatures": [
    {
      "protected": "{{protected-header}}",
      "header": "{{header}}",
      "signature": "{{signature}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `payload`: The Base64URL-encoded payload. This is the data being signed.
- `signatures`: An array of signature objects, each containing the protected header, header, and signature.

  Each signature object may include:

  - `protected`: The Base64URL-encoded protected header (`header` in compact serialization).
  - `header`: The unprotected header in JSON format. The header is not included in the signature.
  - `signature`: The cryptographic signature of the header and payload (`signature` in compact serialization).

For example, a JWS in JSON serialization may look like this:

```json
{
  "payload": "eyJzdWIiOiIx...bGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9",
  "signatures": [
    {
      "protected": "eyJhbGci...InR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9",
      "header": {
        "kid": "2010-12-29"
      },
      "signature": "Xv9da66g3y4nxs...R9CBkOG9GkxfPmq1_7u4tNeXE"
    },
    {
      "protected": "eyJhbGci...InR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9",
      "header": {
        "kid": "2010-12-30"
      },
      "signature": "Yv9da66g3y4nxs...R9CBkOG9GkxfPmq1_7u4tNeXE"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above example, there are two signatures (`signatures` array) for the same payload. Each signature object contains the protected header, header, and signature.
